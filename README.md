# Peacock / Skyshowtime for Kodi

**This addon is under development and is barely usable. Login doesn't work.**

In order to login you need to get the cookie from a web browser and copy it to `userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.skyott/peacocktv` with the name `cookie.conf`.

Playback may work on Androd devices for Peacock.

Skyshowtime doesn't work because I don't know the key to generate the header signatures.

Note:
 My intention was to develop an addon for Skyshowtime, but since I don't know how to generate the header signatures and Peacock uses the same API, and in this case the key for the header signatures is known, I ended up creating an addon for Peacock. I'm not even subscribed to Peacock, I created an account and fortunately they allow to play some videos without a subscription.
