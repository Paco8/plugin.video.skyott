# Peacock / Skyshowtime for Kodi

**This addon is under development and is barely usable. Login doesn't work.**

You can select Peacock or SkyShowtime in the addon settings

In order to login you need to get the cookie from a web browser and copy it to `userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.skyott/peacocktv` with the name `cookie.conf`.

Skyshowtime doesn't work because I don't know the key to generate the header signatures.

**Note:** my intention was to develop an addon for Skyshowtime, but since I don't know how to generate the header signatures and Peacock uses the same API (and in this case the key for the header signatures is known), I ended up creating an addon for Peacock. I'm not even subscribed to Peacock, I created an account and fortunately they allow to play some videos without a subscription. I'm not even in the US, so I had to use free proxies to access Peacock. However, these proxies are very slow and often don't work at all, which makes it difficult for me to even play those videos.
